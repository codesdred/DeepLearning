# Deep Learning 

> Artificial Neural Neurals
1. Learnt basic structure of Neural Networks.
2. Implemented a simple Neural Network that works on Churn Modeling.
3. Churn Modeling is detecting employees that are likely to leave the company,
   so correct actions can be taken on time.

> Recurrent Neural Networks
1. Learnt basics of Recurrent Networks.
2. Learnt about problems with standard RNN like Vanishing Gradient Problem.
3. Learnt about remedies like LSTM - Long Short term memory.
4. Implemented a Stacked LSTM Network to predict Google Stock Prices.

> Boltzmann Machines
1. Learnt basic structure of Fully connected and restricted Boltzmann Machines.
2. Learnt effective methods of training them like contractive divergence method.
3. Made a Recommender Network using MovieLens Dataset.
